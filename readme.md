# Madog's Mad Rhythm Sheet

#### With additions by Dr. Duck

## Structure

* `Madog.ly` is the main file to run & compile
* `common.ly` defines common variables and functions
* The rhythms are sorted into various `#.ly` files according to the
  numerator on their time signature
* `swing.ly` contains rhythms that make the most sense when swung.
  Rhythms outside of `swing.ly` are assumed to be played straight.
